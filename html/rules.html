		<h1><span style="color: #993300;">Server Rules</span></h1>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 0: Listen to the Admins</span></h2>

		<p>The staff are volunteers here to play and enjoy the game just like you; we're not here to debate decisions or argue over what these rules mean. Respect the decisions and rule interpretations made by server staff and move on when a ruling is made. Disagreements can be discussed in the Discord / OOC chat after the game.&nbsp;</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 1: Don't be a Dick</span></h2>

		<p>This applies to IC and OOC. We're all here to have fun! Actively and intentionally ruining the game for others, such as griefing or hostile behaviour, is your fastest way to getting banned. We don't expect every player or their in game characters to be friends with each other, but you should at least be respectful when interacting. Be nice to new players as well; we all know how steep the learning curve is for this game.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Remember the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you want to be treated!</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 2: No Bigotry</span></h2>

		<p>No racism, sexism, homphobia, etc. Hatred is not welcome here and will not be tolerated either IC or OOC. A bigoted character in game would never make it to working on a major space station just as an openly bigoted worker in real life would never make it far in a company like Google.</p>
		<p>This includes a ban on crude, hateful slurs and their "cute" variations, even when used in friendly or joking contexts. No one wants to read them, so don't bother typing them.</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 3: Roleplaying Expectations</span></h2>

		<p>Mana Forge is a medium RP server, meaning we look to maintain a semi-serious roleplaying level somewhere between the low RP of /TG/ and the high RP of Bay.&nbsp;You are more than welcome to have a full backstory and stay in character as much as possible. You are also expected to roleplay within the context created by the game world IE: You are a professional, competent employee who has been selected to work on an elite research station; your in game character should reflect this.</p>
		<p>That being said if you want to relax a bit more feel free as well! We do not expect every player to write out vast paragraphs detailing their actions and character stories. Everyone has a different RP comfort zone and we ask that people operating on different levels respect those of their peers. Don't rag on the people who "aren't roleplaying to your standards" and likewise don't dismiss the people who "aren't taking this seriously enough."</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 4: No Metagaming</span></h2>

		<p>The paranoia is part of what makes SS13 so much fun. Metagaming just spoils the game for both yourself and others. Don't use OOC knowledge while In Character. Don't immediately shout that someone is a traitor because they punched you once. If your character cannot reasonably know something within the context of the game world, then don't do / shout about it.</p>
		<p>Metafriending - having your character maintain friendships with other characters between rounds - is permitted. We all tend to play as the same characters every round, it's reasonable to accept they know each other. That being said, metafriending is not an excuse to give in-game advantages between players. Characters should not promote each other to higher roles or help each other in antag actions purely because they are friends.</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 5: Play The Job You Get</span></h2>

		<p>Stick to the role you have been given for the round. We get it, sometimes you don't get to play the job you really wanted and that's disappointing. However, that's not a reason for you to bail on the job you received and try to perform the job of someone else.</p>
		<p>This also ties into metagaming. Most of us, especially veteran players, know how to perform pretty much every role however that does not mean our characters do. A botanist would not understand how a singularity generator works, and an engineer has no clue what xenobio entails. There is wiggle room here however, Heads of Staff are generally accepted to have greater knowledge of the station's workings, especially concerning their own departments, than a standard employee.</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 6: Keep it PG-13</span></h2>

		<p>No ERP (Erotic Roleplay). Period. This server does not exist for players to get their rocks off. Yes there's pixelated nudity in the game but this isn't an excuse to have full blown sexual RP. If anything, you should be careful with in game nudity as streaking is absolutely a valid reason for security to throw you in the brig.</p>
		<p>Overly sexual character names and descriptions are also not permitted. There are other SS13 servers available for you to enjoy sexuality.</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 7: Play Antagonists Responsibly</span></h2>

		<p>Antagonist roles do not give you a licence to murder and/or rip apart the entire station (with the obvious exception of Nuke OPs, Cults, and other roles explicitly focused on fighting the entire station). Play antag roles with everyone's enjoyment in mind, including your own. A quiet, subtle traitor is a lot more scary and fun to deal with than a loud, guns blazing psychotic that unleashes the singularity before getting toolboxed. You are the driving force of a round, the source of drama and excitement! Give people a good show instead of a deathmatch.</p>
		<p>Don't camp arrivals either. Give people who just joined a chance to actually play the game.</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 8: Do Not Self Antag</span></h2>

		<p>If the game did not pick you to be the round's antagonist, then you are not the atagonist. Don't act like one if aren't one. Now we know SS13 can get pretty chaotic, but there's a difference between intentionally causing trouble and accidents or pranks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>IC violence should be kept under control. Dealing with antagonists and troublemakers is primarily the job of security, not any other role. Someone running into your office and refusing to leave for example is not an excuse to beat them senseless and throw them into disposals. If you did that in the real world you'd be in the unemployment line and in cuffs pretty quickly. The same applies here.</p>

		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 9: Concerning Validhunting</span></h2>
		<p>As stated in Rule 8, dealing with most antags and troublemakers is primarily the role of Security. If the presence of a traitor or other antagonist is confirmed, the entire station shouldn't collapse into a massive witch hunt. Some departments, like mining and R&amp;D, can become incredibly powerful over the course of a round making these witch hunts a general nightmare for an antag to play against. Stick to your role and let Security fulfill theirs.</p>
		<p>Naturally, this rule doesn't apply when facing against certain antagonists like Nuke Ops and Cults who explicitly exist to fight the entire station. Everyone is also permitted to exercise self defense if an antagonist targets or attacks them, or tries to interfere with their department. You're not expected to be a passive bystander, just as you aren't expected to be Judge Dredd.</p>
		
		<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Rule 10: No Politics</span></h2>
		<p>We encourage everyone to actively engage in their civic duties, however this server is not the place for it. We're here to immerse ourselves in SS13 and forget about the general state of the world for a bit.</p>
		
		<p><strong>If you have any questions about our rules or need clarification, please don't hesitate to ahelp. The staff are here to help you!</strong></p>
